PURPOSE

Glob builds lists of files from the file system using a query syntax. Glob also
provides a handful of file system comfort methods, like temporary directories,
file copy, directory copy, recursive delete, java.util.regex based grep, file
slurping and looping.

MOTIVATION

Glob is meant to make file operations comfortable, giving a Java programmer the
ability bash files around as if they were scripting.

The Glob library adds a few missing methods to Java. Glob provides methods for
navigating a local file system, a proper file system, returning sets of
java.io.File objects.

Glob adds some comfort, but stays close to the metal.

Glob is not meant to be a virtual file system. Glob does not abstracts zip files
or HTTP requests into a virtual file system. I'm not sure why that would be
desirable. I can imagine that such a design goal would lead to cumbersome file
operations and opaque network operations. That will never be my goal for Glob.
